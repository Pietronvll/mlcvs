## Interpretability roadmap

- [ ] Test the FISTA solver on classical benchmarks
- [ ] Add exceptions about `num_iter` and `tol`, if the optimization did not succeed
- [ ] Add tools to extract the feature indices and the feature importance
- [ ] Add tools to partition the classification problems into binary ones
- [ ] Add functions to efficiently (warm start) find the optimization path
- [ ] Add model selection and validation functions.
